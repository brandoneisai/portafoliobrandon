    <div class="estrofa">
    <p>Feeling my way through the darkness<br>
        Guided by a beating heart<br>
        I can't tell where the journey will end<br>
        But I know where to start<br>
        They tell me I'm too young to understand<br>
        They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
        Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br>
        Well, that's fine by me</p>
     </div>
     <div class="coro">
    <p>So wake me up when it's all over<br>
        When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
        All this time I was finding myself<br>
        And I didn't know I was lost<br>
        So wake me up when it's all over<br>
        When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
        All this time I was finding myself<br>
        And I didn't know I was lost</p>
    </div>
    <div class="estrofa">
    <p>I tried carrying the weight of the world<br>
        But I only have two hands<br>
        Hope I get the chance to travel the world<br>
        But I don't have any plans<br>
        Wish that I could stay forever this young<br>
        Not afraid to close my eyes<br>
        Life's a game made for everyone<br>
        And love is a prize</p>

    <p>I didn't know I was lost<br>
        I didn't know I was lost<br>
        I didn't know I was lost<br>
        I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know</p>
